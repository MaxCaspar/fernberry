# Workflow: Get Planning Guidance

## Objective
Help decide the right planning approach based on project state and goals.

## Steps
1. Understand the situation
- What's the project/idea?
- How far along are you? (idea, started, mid-project, almost done)
- What feels unclear?

2. Recommend an approach
Just an idea:
Start with Brief. Capture vision before diving in.

Know what to build, unclear how:
Create Roadmap. Break into phases first.

Have phases, need specifics:
Plan Phase. Get Codex-executable tasks.

Mid-project, lost track:
Audit current state. What exists? What's left?

Project feels stuck:
Identify the blocker. Is it planning or execution?

3. Offer next action
```
Recommendation: [approach]

Because: [one sentence why]

Start now?
1. Yes, proceed with [recommended workflow]
2. Different approach
3. More questions first
```

## Decision Tree
```
Is there a brief?
|-- No -> Create Brief
`-- Yes -> Is there a roadmap?
         |-- No -> Create Roadmap
         `-- Yes -> Is current phase planned?
                  |-- No -> Plan Phase
                  `-- Yes -> Plan Chunk or Generate Prompts
```

## Common Situations
"I have an idea but don't know where to start"
Brief first. 5 minutes to capture vision.

"I know what to build but it feels overwhelming"
Roadmap. Break it into 3-5 phases.

"I have a phase but tasks are vague"
Plan Phase with Codex-executable specificity.

"I have a plan but Codex keeps going off track"
Tasks aren't specific enough. Add Files/Action/Verification.

"Context keeps running out mid-task"
Tasks are too big. Break into smaller chunks + use handoff.

## Success Criteria
- User's situation understood
- Appropriate approach recommended
- User knows next step
