# Codex Skill Best Practices

## Core Structure
- Keep SKILL.md concise and under ~500 lines.
- Use structured sections: Objective, Steps/Process, Success Criteria.
- Prefer progressive disclosure: move depth into references/.

## Routing
- If multiple workflows exist, use a router-style SKILL.md.
- Keep routing logic explicit and readable.

## Filesystem Layout
- `SKILL.md` for routing and essentials.
- `workflows/` for procedures.
- `references/` for reusable knowledge.
- `templates/` for common outputs.

## Content Quality
- Be explicit about inputs and outputs.
- Provide verification steps when possible.
- Avoid needless questions; only ask when critical.
