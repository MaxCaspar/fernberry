# Iteration And Testing

Skills improve through real usage. Iterate based on observed failures, not assumptions.

## Workflow

1. Test the skill on representative tasks.
2. Note where it fails or needs extra context.
3. Update SKILL.md or references to fix the gaps.
4. Re-test.

## Checkpoints

- Description triggers the skill when expected.
- Steps are followed without missing actions.
- Success criteria are measurable and achievable.
