# Core Principles

## Concise Is Key

Assume Codex is capable. Only include context it cannot infer. Prefer short examples over long explanations.

## Match Freedom to Risk

- High freedom for creative or exploratory tasks.
- Low freedom for fragile, error-prone, or compliance-bound tasks.

## Use Structured Sections

Use Markdown headings like Objective, Steps, and Success Criteria. Avoid XML tags.

## Progressive Disclosure

Keep SKILL.md small. Put deep details and long examples in references/ and link them.

## Determinism When Needed

If a task repeats or is error-prone, provide scripts or templates instead of prose.

## Iterate with Real Usage

Test the skill on real tasks, capture failures, and update the content to address them.
