# Use Structured Sections

Codex skills should use clear Markdown section headings instead of XML tags. This keeps skills readable and consistent across editors.

## Required Sections

Include these in every skill:

- `## Objective` - what the skill does and why it matters
- `## Steps` or `## Process` - how to do the task
- `## Success Criteria` - how to know it worked

## Optional Sections

Add these only when they help:

- `## Context` - state to gather before starting
- `## Output` - files to create or modify
- `## Verification` - checks to run after changes
- `## Testing` - test commands and expected results
- `## Examples` - input/output examples
- `## Anti-Patterns` - common mistakes to avoid

## Guidance

- Keep headings concise and semantic.
- Avoid deeply nested structures.
- Prefer short, actionable steps over long prose.
- Use code fences for commands and examples.
